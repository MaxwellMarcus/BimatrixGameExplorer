Quick little project mostly made using Cursor, which was a really cool experience. The point is to be able to explore how nash equilibra work within 2x2 bimatrix games. The hue of the colors within the grid represent the point values of that cell. One can play the game of maximizing points or trying to guess what the other player's matrix looks like by clicking the second grid and adjusting the hues. It's really not a ffun game to play but it is interesting to see what the Nash equilibria are (can be done by inspecting and checking the console). Mostly, though, it was really fun to try to make the game with Cursor. Cursor is really good at styling things and animating them so that everything looks nice. It is not so good at figuring out how to find Nash equilibria.
